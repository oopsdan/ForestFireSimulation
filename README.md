## Introduction

The Forest Fire Simulation project is a JavaFX project created for educational purposes within the BlueJ IDE. It is designed to simulate the propagation of a forest fire in a grid-based environment.

## Features

- Dynamic grid visualization of the forest and burnt areas.
- Adjustable density of trees in the forest.
- Start and stop simulation controls.
- Real-time display of the percentage of burnt area.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation on your local machine using BlueJ, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oopsdan/ForestFireSimulation.git
 
2. Open the project in BlueJ.

3. Run the MainAplikacia.java file.

## Usage
Adjust the density of trees using the slider.
Click the "Nastaviť" button to apply the changes to the grid.
Click the "Spustiť" button to start or stop the fire spread simulation.
